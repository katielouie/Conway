# Conway's Game of Life

I decided to make [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) in Processing.

## Controls
**Play/Pause** - Spacebar

**Randomize** - R key

**Change individual cell** - click on cell

**Clear Grid** - C Key
I might add some more features later but we will see :D
